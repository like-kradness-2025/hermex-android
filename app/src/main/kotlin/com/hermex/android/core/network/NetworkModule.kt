/**

 * instance -- [createApi] builds a fresh one per server URL, mirroring the iOS client's
 * `clientFactory: (URL) -> AuthAPIClient` pattern (onboarding's "test connection" probes a
 * candidate URL before it's ever persisted). All instances share the same cookie jar and
 * interceptor, since cookies are already scoped by request URL.
 *
 * CSRF note: the server validates `Origin`/`Referer` against `Host` on POSTs, and treats their
 * *absence* as a trusted non-browser client (see API_CONTRACT.md). OkHttp/Retrofit never send
 * these headers unless an interceptor explicitly adds them -- do not add one here. This is
 * load-bearing for login/session calls working at all.
